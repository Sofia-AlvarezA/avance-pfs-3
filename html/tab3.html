<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <b><li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li></b>
  <p>
    When we observe the graphic , we can realize that in the regression there is
    a notable increase between the variables over the months, this is due to the
    fact that there have been different variations in the energy consumption in
    Kwh. For example, in month one the value of the "true consume" of energy was
    high, however in month 2 there was a great decrease, but what the other
    months have in common is that the energy in Kwh began to increase and
    regressions too.
  </p>
  <b><li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li></b>
  <p>
    The relation is that depending on where the red dots are located, taking
    into account their data and how they vary, the regression is formed.
    Regarding the graph we can notice that the variables of the red dots are
    scattered, but their values are not very far apart, only month two is the
    one that represents the lowest consumption of energy kWh compared to the
    other months.
  </p>
  <b
    ><li>
      Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
      syntax in order to compute that. $$ y=(1.80)(6) + (107.40)= 118.2 $$
      <p>
        R=/It is estimated that next month 118.2 KWH will consume.
      </p>

  <b>
    <li>
      A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
      remain stable the consumption of electric energy.

  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic

</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables.
